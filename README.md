THis repository has two files
1. AMP.html - This is an AMP page. I have added the AMP GTM container and linked to UA 
2. page2.html - This is a non-amp page. I have added GTM container and linked to the same UA
3. The project is setup to see hits sent to GA from both pages and how they work
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page to see some additional buttons to click and switch between pages
